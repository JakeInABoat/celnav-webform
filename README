A simple web based precomputation form completely inspired by celnav for MSFS.

All fields are editable, and clicking on the star selection azimuth diagram (top left) will
add sequential numbers as reference, middle click to clear.

You can use the form at top of page to save/load/delete forms to your browsers local
storage. Enter a name and press save, use the dropdown box to see saved forms which
you can load or delete. You can also print to svg for more permanent (but uneditable)
storage if desired.
